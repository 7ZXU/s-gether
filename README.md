# s-gether

## Background

There are 6.4 million posts on Instagram with hashtags related to Gongstagram, and the demand for Gongstagram is still high. Those who play Gongstagram say that the post motivates them to fulfill their goals or plans. In addition, non-face-to-face studies caused by Pandemic are sweeping the university district. In response, our team tried to create a platform where users can create their own official Instagram, study recruitment, and to-do list.
